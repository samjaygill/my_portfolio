    bio: "This project marked my initial endeavour following the completion of the Python module. It felt rewarding to consolidate all the knowledge I had acquired in Python. I utilized Flask for deploying the application and employed SQL as the database. The project itself is a Traveler's Bucket List application, which enables users to perform various actions such as browsing all destinations, viewing specific destinations, removing destinations, adding new ones, and searching for specific destinations.",

    bio: "This marked my initial project within the Javascript module. It was quite satisfying to employ React for deploying this project, allowing for immediate visibility of any changes. Notably, this project doesn't involve a database. The project itself serves as a Hotel application, offering users the ability to peruse all bookings, verify a user's check-in status, make new bookings, and remove existing bookings.",

    bio: "This marked my initial project upon finishing the Javascript module and it also constituted my inaugural experience with a group project. We opted for React to launch the application and employed mongoDB as our database. The collaborative aspect and the presence of project deadlines were both beneficial aspects of this endeavour. As we couldn't locate an API containing all the desired information, we took the initiative to create our own API using seed data. The project itself functions as a recipe application, enabling users to peruse a collection of recipes, access individual recipes, bookmark recipes as favourites, compile ingredient lists for shopping, perform specific recipe searches, and even contribute their own recipes to the platform.",
